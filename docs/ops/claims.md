# Efficiency & Performance Claims

This page provides guidance on presenting SuperGreen Energy’s technology claims in a defensible way.

## Key principles

1. Define measurement methodology (what exactly is being measured)
2. Cite independent validation (third-party testing)
3. Compare apples to apples (capacity factor vs conversion efficiency)
4. Qualify extraordinary claims ("up to X%" is safer than "X%")

## Solar efficiency (context)

Typical commercial solar panel conversion efficiency under standard test conditions (STC):
- Monocrystalline: 17–22%
- Polycrystalline: 15–17%
- Thin-film: 10–13%

---

## Wind efficiency (context)

Wind is often discussed via capacity factor (actual output vs rated capacity):
- Theoretical maximum (Betz limit): 59.3%
- Modern turbines: ~35–45% of wind energy captured
- Capacity factor: 25–45%

---

## Recommended wording

Avoid:

> “99% efficiency — light years beyond solar and wind”

Better:

> “Our TesDison battery storage and energy production system is designed to deliver sustained power output with minimal energy loss, targeting operational efficiency significantly higher than conventional renewable generation technologies. Independent validation pending.”

With specific claims (preferred):

> “In controlled testing, our modular battery system demonstrated [X]% round-trip efficiency for energy storage and [Y]% uptime availability. Testing conducted by [Lab Name] on [Date].”

## Evidence checklist

Before making public efficiency claims:

- [ ] Written test methodology document
- [ ] Independent laboratory test results
- [ ] Clear definition of “efficiency” in your context
- [ ] Comparison baseline clearly stated
- [ ] Legal review of marketing materials
- [ ] Disclaimer for forward-looking statements
