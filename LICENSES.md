# Licensing

This project is **dual-licensed** under your choice of:

- **MIT License** (see [LICENSE-MIT](./LICENSE-MIT))
- **Apache License 2.0** (see [LICENSE-APACHE](./LICENSE-APACHE))

## Why Dual License?

We want maximum compatibility and protection:

- **MIT** provides simplicity and broad compatibility
- **Apache 2.0** adds explicit patent grants and patent retaliation protection

## Which License Should I Use?

**Choose whichever license works best for your project.**

- If you prefer MIT's simplicity → use the MIT license
- If you want explicit patent protection → use the Apache 2.0 license
- Both licenses are permissive and allow commercial use

## For Contributors

## Patent Grant (Apache 2.0)
