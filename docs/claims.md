# Efficiency & Performance Claims

> This document provides guidance on how to present SuperGreen Energy's technology claims in a defensible manner.

## Key Principles

1. **Define measurement methodology** - Always specify what is being measured
2. **Cite independent validation** - Third-party testing adds credibility
3. **Compare apples to apples** - Don't mix capacity factor with conversion efficiency
4. **Qualify extraordinary claims** - "Up to X%" is safer than "X%"

## Solar Panel Efficiency (Context)

Commercial solar panels typically achieve:
- **Monocrystalline**: 17-22% conversion efficiency
- **Polycrystalline**: 15-17% conversion efficiency
- **Thin-film**: 10-13% conversion efficiency

These figures represent the percentage of sunlight energy converted to electricity under standard test conditions (STC).

## Wind Turbine Efficiency (Context)

Wind turbine efficiency is often confused with capacity factor:
- **Theoretical maximum (Betz limit)**: 59.3%
- **Modern turbines**: 35-45% of wind energy captured
- **Capacity factor**: 25-45% (actual output vs. rated capacity)

## Recommended Wording for SGE Claims

### ❌ Avoid

> "99% efficiency - light years beyond solar and wind"

### ✅ Better

> "Our TesDison battery storage and energy production system is designed to deliver sustained power output with minimal energy loss, targeting operational efficiency significantly higher than conventional renewable generation technologies. Independent validation pending."

### ✅ With Specific Claims

> "In controlled testing, our modular battery system demonstrated [X]% round-trip efficiency for energy storage and [Y]% uptime availability. Testing conducted by [Lab Name] on [Date]."

## Evidence Checklist

Before making public efficiency claims, ensure you have:

- [ ] Written test methodology document
- [ ] Independent laboratory test results
- [ ] Clear definition of "efficiency" in your context
- [ ] Comparison baseline clearly stated
- [ ] Legal review of marketing materials
- [ ] Disclaimer for forward-looking statements

Performance figures are based on internal testing and simulations. 
Actual results may vary based on environmental conditions, installation, 
and usage patterns. Independent third-party validation is ongoing.
