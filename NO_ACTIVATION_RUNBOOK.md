# SGE Platform: No-Activation Runbook

## Purpose

This runbook outlines how to safely maintain the SGE Energy platform in its current dormant state indefinitely. It provides structured guidance for **doing nothing actively** while preserving all options for future activation.

**Status**: ✅ SAFE • ✅ DORMANT • ✅ OPTIONS PRESERVED

---

## Current State Confirmation

### ✅ System Status
- **Contracts**: Deployed but immutable (no execution capability)
- **Keys**: No operational keys loaded into any runtime
- **Wallets**: No wallets funded for use
- **Processes**: No automatic processes running
- **Access**: No external user impact possible

### ✅ Repository Status
- **Code**: Committed and version-controlled
- **Documentation**: Complete system overview available
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipeline ready
- **Security**: No exposed credentials or active endpoints

---

## Safe Dormancy Maintenance (Monthly Checklist)

### 1. Repository Health (5 minutes)
```bash
# Check for security alerts
# Review dependency updates
# Ensure no accidental commits of sensitive data
```

**Action Required**: None (GitHub handles most of this)
**Risk if neglected**: Very low (dormant system)

### 2. Contract Monitoring (Optional, 2 minutes)
- Visit Etherscan for deployed contracts
- Confirm no unexpected transactions
- Note: Contracts are immutable once deployed

**Action Required**: None (passive monitoring only)
**Risk if neglected**: Very low (no execution capability)

### 3. GitHub Pages Demo (Optional, 1 minute)
- Confirm demo site loads: https://unykornai.github.io/sge/app/
- Verify it shows "Offline" status appropriately

**Action Required**: None (auto-deploys on commit)
**Risk if neglected**: Very low (demo-only impact)

### 4. Dependency Awareness (Quarterly)
- Review major dependency updates
- Consider security patches for critical components
- No urgency: dormant system

**Action Required**: None (unless security alerts appear)
**Risk if neglected**: Low (no active execution)

## What Triggers Activation Consideration

### 🚨 High-Signal Triggers (Consider Activation)
- Personal readiness and interest
- Clear use case identified
- Resources available for operation
- Legal/compliance requirements met

### 📊 Low-Signal Triggers (Safe to Ignore)
- "What if" questions
- External pressure or suggestions
- Market timing curiosity
- Technical curiosity alone

### ❌ Never Triggers (Maintain Dormancy)
- System "aging" concerns
- Maintenance overhead fears
- Opportunity cost worries
- External validation needs

## Activation Readiness Checklist (When Considering)

### Pre-Activation Assessment
- [ ] Personal motivation confirmed
- [ ] Use case clearly defined
- [ ] Risk tolerance assessed
- [ ] Resource availability confirmed
- [ ] Legal/compliance reviewed

### Technical Readiness
- [ ] Environment variables prepared (but not loaded)
- [ ] Wallet generation strategy planned
- [ ] Funding approach decided
- [ ] Monitoring setup planned
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

### Operational Readiness
- [ ] Support resources identified
- [ ] Communication plan ready
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Exit strategy planned

## Emergency Procedures (Unlikely But Planned)

### If Repository Compromised
1. Assess impact (dormant = low risk)
2. Rotate any exposed tokens/keys (none currently)
3. Create new repository if needed
4. Document incident

### If Contracts Show Unexpected Activity
1. Investigate via Etherscan
2. Assess if related to SGE system
3. Document findings
4. Consider contract pause if available

### If External Pressure Increases
1. Reference this runbook
2. Share system overview document
3. Reaffirm dormant status
4. Maintain boundaries

## Mental Health Maintenance

### Healthy Mindset
- **This is an asset, not a liability**
- **Waiting is a valid, strong choice**
- **No external validation required**
- **Options remain fully available**

### Decision Framework
- **Activate only when excited, not obligated**
- **Default to dormancy unless clear signal**
- **Trust documented assessment over impulse**
- **Remember: control is preserved**

## Final Reminder

**You are in control.** The system exists to serve your intentions, not create obligations. Dormancy is a valid, responsible state that preserves all future options.

**Status**: MAINTAINING SAFE DORMANCY • OPTIONS PRESERVED • NO PRESSURE ✅
